Step: 100
	Welcome to AMTI's NetForce application designed to interface with AMTI's multiaxis
force and moment measurement dynamometers.  

	This program will lead you through a series of first time installation procedures
to setup the NetForce program.  Later on you may change any of these settings using the 
various options on the main screen of the NetForce program.

	During the following steps various dialog boxes will be displayed on the screen overlaying
these instructions.  If the dialog box covers the instructions you may move it by pressing the
left mouse button over the blue bar on the top of the dialog box.  You may then drag the dialog
box out of the way to read the instructions.

Step: 101
	This program was designed to perform optimally with a Display Mode of 800 x 600.  We 
recommend that you set your monitor to that resolution before proceeding.  You may select No
now and make that setting and restart this program later.

Step: 200
	NetForce supports both biomechanics and industrial (test and measurement) applications.
Some options for the one are inappropriate for the other.  If your application is primarily
biomechanics (i.e. gait or balance or other human or animal subject oriented testing) then 
please respond YES to this message box.  If your application industrial (test or measurement)
then please respond NO.

Step: 300
	Please select the hardware configuration that corresponds to the hardware that you have
installed and will be using with the NetForce software.  You may change the hardware
configuration at a later date from the setup option of the main menu of the program
if you so chose.

Step: 310

Step: 400
	You may now select an initial configuration file which will set up various display and data
acquisition parameters.  We have provided four files for different applications.  All of the
settings may be changed later using the various menus and options available in the NetForce
program.

	1) Industrial1000	-- Recommended for DigiAmp (all) and MiniAmp analog applications.
	2) Industrial200	-- Recommended for MiniAmp Serial test and measurement applications.
	3) Gait1000			-- Recommended for DigiAmp (all) and MiniAmp analog applications.
	4) Gait200			-- Recommended for AccuGait applications.

	This step allows you to setup regional specific information.  The region selection 
applies only to the date format used to automatically generate date strings.  You must
install the desired region using the Windows control panel first.  If you are in doubt
select United States of America now and use the Region option in the setup menu later.

	You may also chose between English and metric units at this time.  

Step: 600
	The data folder becomes the default in which both data files and the subject
database will be maintained.  You may keep different studies in different folders
but for now you should set up a single folder to get started.  You may later use 
the Data Folder button in setup to make (and select) different folders.

Using the Select data folder dialog box

To select an existing folder:
	1) Use the navigation controls to navigate to the desired folder.
	2) Double click on the desired folder
	3) The folder name will be displayed in the Look in: window.
	4) Click Open
	5) A message box will be displayed showing you the name of the selected folder.
	6) Press "OK"

To create a new folder
	1) Use the navigation controls to navigate to the desired folder.
	2) Click the New Folder icon on the tool bar (move mouse slowly over the icons to see the name)
	3) A new folder icon will appear with the name "New Folder" to the right of the icon.
	4) Type a name of your choice. (this will replace the name "New Folder")
	5) Click on white space outside of the new folder name.
	6) Wait until the new folder name is highlighted. (this takes a few seconds)
	7) Select Open
	8) Now your new folder name will appear in Look in:
	9) Select Open
	10) A message box will be displayed showing you the name of the selected folder.
	11) Press "OK"

Step: 700
